Hello

The makefile will compile both avx.cpp and taylor.c

default to compute 15 terms, please change the #define statement if
you want to see a different number of terms.

taylor.c is the regular one that asks the user to input a number and
compute 15 terms of e^x.

avx.cpp uses avx extension, however my code failed to make a difference.
