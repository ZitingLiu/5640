Hello, the makefile compiles both of the benchmark files.

The linpack.c contains both single and double precision benchmarking,
to switch to single or double, go to line#31 in linpack.c
#define DP for double and SP for single. 

memory_test.c is the other benchmark test which does not require any changes.

Thank you
